# Doraemon - A moderation and utility bot for Discord
Doraemon is a moderation and utility bot for Discord, designed with the intent of making Admins and Moderator's jobs easier.

# Contributions & Plans for the future
Issues are the main driving force of Doraemon's development. You can see what's currently being worked on, and what might be being improved. You can also create issues to share your ideas, or any issues you may encounter with Doraemon. Please note that Github automatically checks pull-requests for a warn-less build, it might be worth it to run `dotnet build -c Release /warnaserror` on your branch before opening a pull request.
